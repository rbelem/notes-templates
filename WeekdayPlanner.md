## Day Planner
"The wise will start each day with the thought, 'Fortune gives us nothing which we can really own.'" -- Seneca

"When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly. They are like this because they can't tell good from evil." -- Marcus Aurelius

"The cucumber is bitter? Then throw it out. There are brambles in the path? Then go around them. That's all you need to know. Nothing more." -- Marcus Aurelius

"Don't be overheard complaining... not even to yourself." -- Marcus Aurelius
